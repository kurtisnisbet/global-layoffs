-- Data cleaning pathway
-- 0. Copy raw dataset
	-- Dataset will be changed, so retaining a raw version is useful.
    -- Never work on the only copy of the raw data. It is not best practice.
-- 1. Remove Duplicates
	-- Usually first step when cleaning data
-- 2. Standardise data
	-- Removes issues with spelling errors, etc.
-- 3. Null/blank values
	-- Lots of null/blank. Will try to populate these fields
-- 4. Remove unncessary columns and rows
	-- There are instances when you should and shouldn't do this. 

-- Creating coopy of raw dataset.
